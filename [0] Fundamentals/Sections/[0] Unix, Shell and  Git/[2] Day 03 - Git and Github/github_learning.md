# Github
### GitHub is a web-based platform that allows individuals and teams to collaborate on software projects. It's a central hub for code hosting and collaboration that provides tools for version control, issue tracking, code review, and project management, among others. Some of the key features of GitHub include:

- Git-based version control: GitHub is built on top of Git, a popular distributed version control system. This allows users to keep track of changes to their code over time, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions if necessary.

- Web-based interface: GitHub provides a user-friendly web interface that makes it easy to browse code, view commit history, and collaborate with other users. It also provides a web-based code editor for making quick changes to files without having to download them locally.

- Issue tracking: GitHub provides a built-in issue tracker that allows users to create, assign, and track issues related to their code. This is particularly useful for bug reports, feature requests, and other types of feedback.

- Pull requests and code review: GitHub allows users to submit changes to a project in the form of pull requests. This makes it easy to review changes before they're merged into the main codebase, ensuring that code is high-quality and meets the project's standards.

- Project management: GitHub provides tools for project management, including kanban boards, milestones, and labels. These tools make it easy to track progress, assign tasks, and organize work for larger teams.
