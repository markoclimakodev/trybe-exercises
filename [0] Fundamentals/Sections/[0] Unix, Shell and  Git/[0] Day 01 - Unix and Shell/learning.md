# **Unix & Shell** 

UNIX is a computer operating system that was first developed in the 1960s and 1970s. It was designed to be highly portable and flexible, making it popular for use in a wide range of computer systems.

A shell, on the other hand, is a command-line interface (CLI) that provides users with a way to interact with the operating system by typing in commands. In a UNIX system, the shell is the primary user interface and is responsible for interpreting and executing user commands.
