# Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML is the use of HTML to reinforce the meaning of information on a web page, rather than just defining its structure and presentation. For example, throughout this entire time, you have been using HTML elements with the html, head, body, and form tags. These elements are examples of using Semantic HTML, as each has its content with a defined sense and purpose:

- The ```html``` element represents the type of document in question, which in this case is HTML.
- The ```head``` element represents the metadata of the HTML document, such as the document title, links to CSS and JavaScript files that the document needs.
- The ```body``` element represents all the visual content of the HTML document.
- The ```form``` element represents a form for the user to input data.

# Block elements and inline elements.

| CSS Display| Description  |
| ---------- | -------------|
|```display: none;```|	The element is completely removed from the page and does not take up any space.|
|```display: block;```|	The element is displayed as a block-level element and takes up the full width available.| 
|```display: inline;```|	The element is displayed as an inline-level element and only takes up as much width as necessary.|
|```display: inline-block;```|	The element is displayed as an inline-level element, but can have a width, height, padding, and margin.|
