## ðŸš€ To practice
1. Traverse the array printing all values contained in it using the console.log() function.<br>
2. Add all values in the array and print the result.<br>
3. Calculate and print the arithmetic mean of the values contained in the array.<br>
4. The arithmetic mean is the result of the sum of all elements divided by the total number of elements. <br>
 Based on the code you just generated, if the final value is greater than 20, print the message `"Value greater than 20"`;<br>
  and if it is not greater than 20, print the message `"Value less than or equal to 20"`.<br>
5. Using for, find the highest value in the array and print it.<br>
6. Find out how many odd values exist in the array and print the result. If there are none, print the message: "No odd value found."<br>
7. Using for, find the lowest value in the array and print it.<br>
8. Using for, create an array that goes from 1 to 25 and print the result.<br>
9. Using the array you just created, print the result of dividing each of the elements by 2.<br>
