#  Programming logic
The programming logic consists of a series of rules and standards based on mathematical logic and computer theories,<br>
 which aim to facilitate reasoning when creating a chain of commands.
 It's important to understand that programming logic is not restricted to a specific language, meaning it's applicable to<br> all languages. Therefore, it's easier to learn a language when you already know another one, since the reasoning has already been exercised and only <br>the algorithms need to be adapted.
