# Algorithms

The algorithm is a series of logically linked commands aimed at solving a problem.

This logic is used automatically in many everyday moments. Think, for example, of the step-by-step process of making a chocolate milk to have in the morning:

- Get a glass.
- Place the glass on the table.
- Open the refrigerator door.
- Get the milk.
- Close the refrigerator door.
- Pour a certain amount of milk into the glass.
- Open the cupboard.
- Get the chocolate powder.
- Close the cupboard door.
- Add a certain amount of chocolate powder to the glass.
- Get a spoon.
- Stir the glass with the spoon.
<br>

Using the array below, iterate through it summing all values. If the final value is greater than 15, <br>
print it. If it is equal to or less than 15, print the message: "Value less than 16".
```javascript
let fruits = [3, 4, 10, 1, 12];
```

Problem-solving occurs in three stages:

- Interpretation.
- Algorithm creation.
- Algorithm coding.
Therefore, first interpret what is being asked. This step is crucial to <br> solving the problem.
 If the interpretation is wrong, the algorithm and consequently the code will be wrong.

Analyzing the statement, we know that:

- It is necessary to use the fruits array.
- The term "iterate" indicates a loop structure.
- The expression "summing all values" shows that we need to have a variable that stores the sum of the values.
- The term "if" indicates a conditional structure.
- The expression "print the final value" indicates a console.log.
