# Complexity of the code

Creating overly complex code is not a good practice in the world of programming. It not only <br>
makes the code difficult to follow, but also makes testing and implementing changes more challenging.<br>
It is normal, especially in the beginning, for your code to have complexity errors, and you may need <br>
to find a different way to develop your logic.<br>
To measure the complexity of a code, there is cyclomatic complexity, a software metric that considers the<br>
 independent paths that an algorithm can take. The higher the cyclomatic complexity, the more difficult it 
 <br>will be to follow, maintain, and test the code.<br>
To keep the complexity of a code low, you should always try to simplify the possible paths, such as breaking <br>the code into smaller parts.
<br>
But what are these paths?

For example, if your code has only one conditional (only one if/else), it has two paths: either it does this or it does that. <br>
The more paths there are, the more complex it will be. There are several ways to increase the number of paths, not only <br>
by using conditionals.<br>
You can also, for example, increase the complexity of a code using loops, such as for loops.
