# Primitive Types, Dynamic Typing, and Arithmetic Operations.

### Primitive Types
- Number	
- String
- Boolean	
- Null
- Undefined

<br>

## Dynamic Typing
<br>

```javascript 
let myVariable = 5; // myVariable is of type Number
myVariable = 'hello'; // myVariable is now of type String
```
<br>

## Arithmetic Operations
<br>

```javascript 
const sum = 5 + 3; // sum is equal to 8
const sub = 5 - 3; // sub is equal to 2
const div = 15 / 3; // div is equal to 5
const mult = 15 * 3; // mult is equal to 45
const mod = 20 % 2// mod is equal to 0
const exp = 2 ** 3 // exp is equal to 8

const concat = 'hello ' + 'tryber'; // concat is equal to 'hello tryber'
const isTrue = true && false; // isTrue is equal to false
```
<br>
<br>

## ðŸš€ To practice
Let's do some simple operations to find the area and perimeter of a rectangle with a base of 5 and height of 8.

- Create a variable called base and assign it the value 5.
- Create a variable called height and assign it the value 8.
- Create a variable called area and assign it the result of multiplying the base by the height. Tip: remember to always use console.log() to print the  variables and check the results of the operations!
- Create a variable called perimeter and assign it the sum of all sides of the rectangle.
