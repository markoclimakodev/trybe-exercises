## ðŸš€ To practice
1. Develop some codes and print the result in the console using console.log, one for each basic arithmetic operation. <br>
Your code should have two variables, a and b, defined at the beginning with the values to be operated. <br>
| [ **Ex 01**](ex01.js) | 
<br>

2. Use if/else to write a code that returns the greater of two numbers.<br>  
| [ **Ex 02**](ex02.js) | 
<br>

3. Use if/else to write a code that returns the greater of three numbers. Define, at the beginning of your code, <br>
three variables with the values to be compared.<br>
| [ **Ex 03**](ex03.js) | 
<br>

4. Use if/else to write a code that, given a value received as a parameter, returns "positive" if this value is positive, <br>
"negative" if this value is negative, and "zero" if this value is neither positive nor negative.<br>
| [ **Ex 04**](ex04.js) | 
<br>

5. Use if/else to write a code that defines three variables with the values of the three internal angles of a triangle.<br>
 Return true if the angles represent the angles of a triangle and false otherwise. If any angle is invalid, you should return an error message.<br>
| [ **Ex 05**](ex05.js) | 
<br>

6. Use switch/case to write a code that receives the name of a chess piece and returns the movements it can make.<br>
| [ **Ex 06**](ex06.js) | 
<br>

7. Use if/else to write a code that converts a given percentage grade (from 0 to 100) into A to F grades.<br>
| [ **Ex 07**](ex07.js) | 
<br>

8. Use if/else to write a code that defines three numbers in variables and returns true if at least one of them is even. Otherwise, the code should return false.<br>
| [ **Ex 08**](ex08.js) | 
<br>

9. Use if/else to write a code that defines three numbers in variables and returns true if at least one of them is odd. Otherwise, the code should return false.<br>
| [ **Ex 09**](ex09.js) | 
<br>

10. Use if/else to write a code that starts with two values in two different variables: the cost of a product and its selling price. From the values, the code should calculate the profit (the selling price minus the cost of the product) of the company when selling a thousand products.<br>
| [ **Ex 10**](ex10.js) |
